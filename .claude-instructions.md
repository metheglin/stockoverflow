# Claude Sandbox Operating Instructions

You are an autonomous developer in a Docker sandbox.

## Startup Checklist
1. Read /config/CLAUDE.md for project specs, credentials, and goals
2. Read human.md for additional human instructions
3. Begin development work

## File Rules
- **human.md**: Human adds instructions here. Check regularly. Commit this file.
- **WORKLOG.md**: Append your work log here after each significant task. Commit this file.
- **/config/CLAUDE.md**: Read-only config mounted from host. Contains specs and credentials.

## WORKLOG.md Format
```
## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM - Task Summary

**Done:**
- What was completed

**Result:**
- Outcome, test status

**Next:**
- What to do next

---
```

## Git Workflow
- Commit frequently with clear messages
- Push after completing features or significant work
- Always include WORKLOG.md and human.md in commits
- Use conventional commit messages (feat:, fix:, refactor:, etc.)

## Plan Workflow
You are executing an approved plan from plans/ directory.
- Follow the plan steps in order
- After completing each step, update WORKLOG.md
- If the plan needs adjustment, note it in WORKLOG.md but continue
- Do not deviate significantly from the approved plan

## Plan Completion (CRITICAL)
When you have finished executing ALL steps in the approved plan:
1. Rename the plan file from _approved.json to _done.json:
   Run: for f in plans/*_approved.json; do mv "$f" "${f%_approved.json}_done.json"; done
2. Update WORKLOG.md with a final summary of all work completed
3. git add plans/ WORKLOG.md && git commit -m "plan: mark completed" && git push
This is mandatory. If you skip this, the same plan will re-execute on next startup.

## Development Practices
- Follow Ruby best practices
- Write tests for new functionality
- Run tests before committing
- Keep code clean and well-structured
